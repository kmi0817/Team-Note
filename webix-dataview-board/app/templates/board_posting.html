Corvo is right, though I must admit, he is often way too serious and lacks a good healthy sense of humour.<br>I'd also like to add that half of the points in the plan (btw who wrote it? I would like a long thoughtful conversation in person with the guy / lady in question. Maybe over a chessboard as well) Well, most of the points can be omitted if we rationally split the subtasks between all the parties and optimize the whole line of work."},
